### what sleet key is and what it is not
sleet key is an alternative solution for both users and devs to manage their near account keys and to login to apps and to sign transactions. **But sleet key is not the recommend way to do this nor is it a recommendation to manage keys in this way.**
<br/>
Sleet key is a work in progress. Make sure you know what you are doing, and make sure you keep your keys safe. Remember you can always rotate your keys, but no one can hep you if you lose access to your near account key or if you remove your key without adding a new one.
